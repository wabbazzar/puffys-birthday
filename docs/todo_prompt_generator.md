# Todo Prompt Generator - Master Autonomous Cross-Platform Development Guide

## Purpose
This document provides the exact instructions needed to transform any application specification (spec.md) into a comprehensive, autonomous development plan (todo.md) that enables an AI agent to build fully functional web applications that work seamlessly across both desktop and mobile platforms without human intervention.

## Core Principles of Autonomous Cross-Platform Development

### 1. Visual Verification First
**Never trust console logs alone.** Every feature must be visually verifiable through automated DOM inspection and visual state comparison on both desktop and mobile viewports.

### 2. Mobile-First Progressive Enhancement
Build mobile experience first, then enhance for desktop. Every feature must work on touch devices before adding desktop-specific enhancements.

### 3. Cross-Platform Visual Testing
Build visual test harnesses that work across desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and device simulators. Each phase must have visual verification for both platforms.

### 4. Consistent Implementation Patterns
Establish single methods that handle both desktop and mobile interactions (e.g., one method for all input events whether keyboard, mouse, or touch).

### 5. Performance Across Devices
Optimize for 60 FPS on both desktop and mobile. Mobile performance requirements are stricter and drive overall optimization.

### 6. Browser Cache Awareness
Always include cache-busting headers and version numbers. Test on both desktop and mobile browsers for cache consistency.

### 7. Git-Driven Development Workflow
Use git extensively throughout the development cycle. Commit early and often with descriptive messages. Create commits after each successful phase completion, before attempting new features, and when tests pass. Use git to track progress, enable rollbacks, and maintain development history.

## Structure of Generated Todo.md

### Phase -1: Project Initialization & Development Environment
**CRITICAL: DO THESE FIRST - BEFORE ANY OTHER WORK**

1. **Cursor Rule Creation (MANDATORY)**
   - Create a cursor rule that MUST be enabled at project start
   - Rule should summarize all cross-platform development principles from this document
   - Rule should remain active throughout entire development cycle
   - Include mobile-first, git-driven, and PWA requirements in the rule

2. **Makefile Generation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)**
   - Generate Makefile with all cross-platform commands if not already present
   - Populate with git workflow, testing, and development server commands
   - Ensure mobile-ready server configuration (0.0.0.0 binding)
   - Include all whitelisted commands from this document

### Phase 0: Cross-Platform Environment & Visual Test Infrastructure
**ALWAYS START HERE AFTER INITIALIZATION - NO EXCEPTIONS**

1. **Project Setup**

## Rules for Autonomous Cross-Platform Agent Behavior

### RULE 1: Mobile-First Visual Verification Mandate
```
Every implementation step MUST include visual verification on mobile first, then desktop.
Touch interactions must be tested before keyboard/mouse interactions.
Never proceed without confirming mobile visual functionality.
```

### RULE 2: Cross-Platform Test Infrastructure First
```
ALWAYS create mobile and desktop visual test infrastructure before implementing features.
The test harness must handle:
- Mobile viewport simulation (320px-428px)
- Touch event simulation and gesture recognition
- Desktop viewport testing (1024px+)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Safari Mobile, Chrome Mobile, Desktop browsers)
- Performance monitoring across devices
```

### RULE 3: Unified Method Architecture
```
For any user interaction (input, navigation, updates):
- Create ONE method that handles touch, mouse, and keyboard
- Use event detection to determine input type
- Ensure consistent behavior across platforms
- Document the unified method clearly
```

### RULE 4: Mobile-First Browser Cache Management
```
Every HTML file MUST include mobile-optimized cache control:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">

Test cache behavior on both desktop and mobile browsers.
```

### RULE 5: Cross-Platform Debugging Protocol
```
When visual behavior doesn't match expected:
1. Test on mobile browser dev tools first
2. Check touch event handling vs mouse events
3. Verify responsive design breakpoints
4. Test gesture recognition thresholds
5. Check computed styles on mobile vs desktop
6. Force repaint on both platforms
7. Create minimal reproduction for both platforms
```

### RULE 6: Performance-First Progress Verification
```
After each implementation phase:
1. Test 60 FPS on mobile devices
2. Verify touch responsiveness (<50ms)
3. Check desktop performance improvements
4. Test memory usage on both platforms
5. Validate accessibility on mobile and desktop
6. Document platform-specific optimizations
```

### RULE 7: Git Commit Protocol for Autonomous Development
```
Use git extensively throughout development:
1. Initialize git repository at project start
2. Commit after each successful phase completion
3. Commit before attempting risky changes or new features
4. Use descriptive commit messages that include phase number and feature
5. Create commits when tests pass and functionality is verified
6. Use git status to track progress and uncommitted changes
7. Consider creating tags for major milestones
8. Always commit working code before debugging sessions

Example commit messages:
- "Phase 0: Setup cross-platform test infrastructure and mobile viewport"
- "Phase 1: Implement mobile-first touch controls with visual feedback"
- "Phase 2: Add desktop keyboard enhancements and mouse interactions"
- "Fix: Resolve mobile touch event handling on iOS Safari"
```

### RULE 8: Mandatory Cursor Rule and Makefile Initialization
```
AT PROJECT START (Phase -1), ALWAYS:
1. Create cursor rule FIRST - before any code
2. Generate/verify Makefile SECOND - before any implementation
3. Enable cursor rule and keep active throughout project
4. Cursor rule must contain essence of all cross-platform development rules
5. Makefile must contain all whitelisted commands for autonomous development

Cursor Rule Template:
"Cross-Platform Web Development: Mobile-first implementation with desktop enhancement. 
Use unified input methods for touch/mouse/keyboard. PWA features by default. 
Git commits after each phase. 60 FPS performance on mobile. 44px+ touch targets. 
Visual verification on mobile before desktop. Test harness creation mandatory."
```
