# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hop Hop Puff is a mobile-first HTML5 game built with Phaser.js where Puffy the cat climbs through kitchen platforms to reach beef jerky at the top. This is a cat-themed reimagining of Donkey Kong with responsive design and cross-platform support.

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL (CRITICAL - NO EXCEPTIONS)

### Test-First Development Rules
- **EVERY change MUST be tested immediately after implementation**
- **NEVER deliver code without visual verification on both mobile and desktop**
- **Start local server and test both mobile and desktop views before moving to next change**
- **Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile devices (320px-428px)**
- **Test all interactive elements (joystick, buttons, keyboard) on both platforms**
- **Verify animations, movement, and game mechanics work at 60 FPS**
- **If anything is broken, fix it before moving to next change**
- **Document what was tested and what works/doesn't work**
- **NO EXCEPTIONS - Testing is not optional, it's mandatory**

### Mandatory Commit and Push Protocol
- **EVERY working change MUST be committed AND pushed immediately**
- **Use `git add -A && git commit -m "Description" && git push` after each successful implementation**
- **NEVER leave uncommitted changes sitting locally**
- **Push to remote repository ensures backup and collaboration**
- **Descriptive commit messages with clear explanations**
- **If push fails, resolve conflicts immediately before continuing**
- **NO EXCEPTIONS - Every change must be version controlled and backed up**

   make serve
   make visual-test  # Verify basic canvas rendering
   make mobile-test  # Test mobile viewport (320px-428px)
   ```

2. **Mobile-First Visual Verification**
   - Test on mobile browser dev tools FIRST
   - Verify touch event detection
   - Check 44px+ touch targets
   - Test gesture recognition vs accidental touches
   - Verify 60 FPS performance on mobile

3. **Desktop Enhancement Testing**
   - Test desktop viewport (1024px+) AFTER mobile works
   - Verify keyboard controls don't break mobile
   - Test mouse interactions alongside touch
   - Ensure unified input handling works

### Phase 1: Mobile-First Feature Implementation
1. **Write Mobile Visual Test First**
   ```bash
   # Before implementing any feature:
   make mobile-test     # Test mobile interaction
   make touch-test      # Verify touch responsiveness
   make sprite-test     # Test sprite rendering
   ```

2. **Implement Mobile-First Feature**
   - Touch controls MUST work before keyboard
   - Virtual D-pad functionality takes priority
   - Test on mobile viewport before desktop
   - Verify visual feedback within 50ms

3. **Add Desktop Enhancement**
   - Add keyboard/mouse support AFTER mobile works
   - Test unified input handling
   - Verify desktop doesn't break mobile functionality

### Phase 2: Cross-Platform Integration Testing
1. **Visual Verification Protocol**
   ```bash
   make visual-test     # Cross-platform rendering
   make verify-render   # Render pipeline verification
   make auto-test       # Automated test suite
   ```

2. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   make fps-test        # 60 FPS on mobile and desktop

   - Check for floating point precision issues
2. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Profile on both mobile and desktop
   - Check memory leaks in hazard spawning
   - Verify garbage collection efficiency

## Mandatory Testing Workflow

### Before Every Code Change
1. **Git Status Check**: `git status` to see uncommitted changes
2. **Server Running**: `make serve` to start development server
3. **Mobile Test First**: `make mobile-test` to verify mobile functionality
4. **Desktop Test Second**: `make game-test` to verify desktop functionality

### After Every Code Change
1. **Visual Verification**: Test the specific feature on both platforms
2. **Performance Check**: Verify 60 FPS maintained
3. **Cross-Platform Test**: Ensure change doesn't break other platform
4. **Pre-Commit Testing**: Git hooks automatically run `make test` before commit
5. **Commit and Push**: `git add -A && git commit -m "Description" && git push`

### Before Moving to Next Feature
1. **Full Test Suite**: `make auto-test` for comprehensive testing
2. **Performance Verification**: `make fps-test` and `make memory-test`
3. **Mobile Device Test**: Test on actual mobile device
4. **Documentation Update**: Update test results and known issues

## Pre-Commit Testing System

### Automatic Pre-Commit Hooks
The repository includes Git hooks that automatically run before each commit:

1. **Test File Organization Check**: Ensures all test files are in `tests/` directory
2. **Mobile-First Implementation Check**: Warns about desktop-only code
3. **Performance Requirements Check**: Verifies 60 FPS compliance
4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Runs `make test` to verify all functionality

### Pre-Commit Hook Features
- **Automatic execution**: Runs every time you commit
- **Commit blocking**: Prevents commits if tests fail
- **Cross-platform validation**: Ensures mobile and desktop compatibility
- **Performance verification**: Checks 60 FPS requirements
- **Test organization**: Enforces `tests/` directory structure

### Manual Pre-Commit Testing
You can manually run the pre-commit tests:
```bash
make test              # Run comprehensive test suite
make pre-commit-test   # Alias for make test
```

### Pre-Commit Hook Setup
The hooks are automatically configured in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and include:
- Cross-platform testing validation
- Mobile-first implementation checks
- Performance requirement verification
- Test file organization enforcement

## Important Notes

- **Mobile-first approach**: All development prioritizes mobile experience
- **Test-first development**: Create tests before implementing features
- **Test organization**: ALL test files must be in `tests/` directory
- **Pre-commit testing**: Git hooks run `make test` before allowing commits
- **No package.json**: Pure HTML5 game using CDN-hosted Phaser.js
- **Cache-busting**: Essential for mobile browsers and game asset updates
- **Touch-first controls**: Virtual D-pad with keyboard fallback for desktop
- **Performance critical**: 60 FPS requirement across all platforms
- **Git-driven development**: Commit and push after every successful change
- **Visual verification mandatory**: Never trust console logs alone

## Game Mechanics

- **Objective**: Guide Puffy from bottom to top of kitchen platforms
- **Lives system**: 3 lives with level restart on death
- **Platform structure**: 6 horizontal levels with 2-3 ladders each
- **Controls**: Virtual D-pad (mobile) or WASD (desktop)
